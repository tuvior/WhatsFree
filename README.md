## Important Notes About The App

1. This App will try to access your location. As a consequence, running it on an emulator without
providing a mock location won't enable you to use all the functionalities (Around You tab and Map).
Providing a mock location to the emulator requires tools that need to be configured. An easy way out
is to simply use a physical device and enable location/GPS.
2. The Around You tab performs an Async Task in which a sort is carried out. Unfortunately, it
may be somewhat lengthy, so do not worry if the App freezes for a small amount of time at launch,
or upon changing tab.
